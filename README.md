# Directing Customers to Subscription Through App Behavior Analysis
In this case study we will be working with a fintech company that wants to provide their customers with a paid mobile app subscription that will allow them to track all of their finances in one place. To attract customers the company begins with a freemium revenue model in which the customer can download the app for free but with limited features.

We have to find out based upon a customer's app behavior who is likely to enroll or NOT enroll for the paid version. The company wants to offer these individuals special discounts, thus increasing their chances to buy the paid version.
The company does not want to offer these special discounts to individuals who were going to buy the paid version anyways.
